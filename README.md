# Budget-Tracker-PWA

## Description
For this challenge we were given an application and asked to make it into a Progressive Web Application or PWA. The application is a budget tracker to allow the user to add and subtract their expenses. A PWA allows a web based application to behave much like it would as a mobile application, including offline functionality by caching data input from the user, and being able to add it to the User's home screen as you would with a regular app. This was made possible by adding IndexDB which allows the app to store requests until the device regains internet. Also by adding service workers and a manifest.json file, the app can be installed like any other by adding to the home screen.
